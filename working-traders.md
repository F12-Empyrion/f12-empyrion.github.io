# Working Traders

Because we're running a slightly outdated scenario and fear that upgrading it will cause severe problems, we have some issues with traders which are now broken.

Basically, when you talk to a trader, you either get a CoQ (Close-or-Quit) message dialog, or you get an empty trader dialog, either way you cannot trade with them.

However, the issue is not broadly with *all* traders, but rather it seems that either specific traders in specific trading outposts, or traders we had already discovered
by the time 1.3 was upgraded, are broken.

As such, there *are* some working traders on our server, but they may be far apart.

In general, it seems these types of POIs still have one or more working traders:

* Polaris Mining Foreman
* Polaris Outpost
* Polaris Alloy Synthesis Factory
* Civilian Waystation
* Civilian Settlement
* Talon Bazaar

The following we know doesn't work:

* Polaris Trading Stations
* Polaris Orbital Trading Stations

Here's a list, which will be updated as we discover more of them.

Note that this list is obviously not exhaustive, but you can see what kind of POIs of which factions seems to have working traders, so if you come across
some of these POIs on other planets, which you undoubtedly will, there is probably one or more working traders inside.

## Medical Traders

Medical traders sell and buy medical items, such as bandages, health packs, trauma kits, pills, injections, etc.
