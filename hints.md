# Hints

Here are a bunch of helpful hints to help you play [Empyrion][egs] on the **F12** server (or just in general).

* There are limits in place for how many of different types of weapons you can place on the various types of structures. See the [separate page](structure-limits.md) for more information.
* You can use your drone (hit F5) to pick up your backpack, if you can get close enough to it, and the drone has unobstructed access to it
* In the very early stages of the game, it might be more efficient to just die of hunger than to constantly deal with finding materials for creating 1 food unit
* If you find a really nice blueprint on the [Workshop][workshop], that is CPU compliant (usually says CPU T2, T3 or T4), but it is too costly for you to build in game (the Optronic parts are usually the culprits), a tip is to create a creative local savegame. Spawn it in creative mode (which is free), take out the parts you don't need (like these CPU Extenders), point at the construct and hit Alt+O and save your modified construct under a new blueprint name, and then you can build this one on the server instead.
* To make a cargo container or other block available for use by non-faction people, you can set a code to it. People who know the code can then use it by inputting it every time they want to use the block. If you want everyone to be able to use it, you can use the special code `0000`, as the block will then become public and no code input will be required. Note that this does not allow people to remove the block with a Multi Tool, only to *operate* it.
