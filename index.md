# Welcome Page

Hi, and welcome to the F12 Empyrion Server running the [Reforged Eden](reforged-eden.md) custom scenario in [Empyrion - Galactic Survival][egs].

---

**An important notice about mining deposits!** Deposits and POIs require that they are left in the game for them to regenerate. This means that you should try to avoid mining out the entire deposit, or remove every block from a POI. For deposits, please leave about 5-10% left. We know that on some planets, percentages doesn't drop, so use your own judgement.

Now back to the regular program...

We hope you have a fun time playing on the server but also understand that Empyrion servers are not always identical, so this webpage here aims to tell you all you need to know about playing on the F12 server and how it might differ from other servers you can join.
