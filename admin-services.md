# Admin services

The [Empyrion][egs] game is not bug free. There are some minor issues that crop up from time to time. If you need help resolving an issue that can be attributed to a bug in the game, please ask for help from an admin. Admins are not always on, so there might not be an immediate resolution to your issue, but please ask in game for help and the online players will help if they can.

Examples of services an admin can help with:

* Restoring a broken vessel from backup
* Move you, or your vessels
* Change the faction or ownership of structures
* Refund lost materials or gear

Also see [Known Issues](known-issues.md) further below for some of the usual stuff in this regard.

Note that an admin will probably not help you with restoring lost vessels or materials that were lost because of normal gameplay. For instance, if you venture into a level 10 Zirax area and your ship is shot down, with all your resources, you need to be prepared to handle that loss and possibly fight to get your ship or stuff back. This is part of the game. Bugs, however, should not be.

A non-exhaustive list of bugs that might happen from time to time:

* A ship might sink into the ground if you've modified the ground and then parked your ship on it
* You might get ported away from the ship if the server experiences a lag hiccup
* You might discover that SV's and HV's that were docked to your CV have gone missing after warping

These are examples of problems that an admin can help to resolve. The resolutions might not always be perfect, but we'll try our best to make you happy and get you back into the game.
