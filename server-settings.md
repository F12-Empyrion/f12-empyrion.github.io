# Server Settings

The [Empyrion][egs] game has plenty of settings, so here is a list of the settings that have been specifically set for this server.

| Setting                 | Value        |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| Difficulty              | Hard (1)     | 
| CPU Points              | Disabled (2) |
| Check Mass / Volume     | Disabled (3) |
| Auto Miner Depletion    | Disabled (4) |
| Keep inventory on death | Nothing (5)  |
| Blueprints (6)          | Allowed      |

1. Enemies are tougher to kill and hit harder. Expect more drones in sectors. POIs can be deadly *(but they are still possible*).
2. Please read more about the [CPU Efficiency][cpu] if you want more information, but the important part is that CPU points and thus (in)efficiency have been turned off on this server. All bases and vessels always operate at 100% CPU efficiency regardless of presence of CPU Extenders. Some players, like me, still like to make the constructs CPU Compliant, but this is a personal choice and by no means necessary. See the [Hints](hints.md) section further below for some information about how this might impact your gameplay.
3. You are a superhuman. You can carry big constructors and thousands of big steel blocks without breaking a sweat. Cargo containers only check the amount of occupied slots inside, not what you have in them. You will likely see this in game as a "X / Y" ratio down and to the right of all inventories and the X can *far* overshoot the Y. This is not a problem. The reason for this decision is that most players feel that playing with volume and weight limits enabled makes the game much much more of a hassle than it makes it fun, so this has been turned off.
4. Autominers does not deplete deposits. However, see [Known Issues](known-issues.md) below for some *important* information about autominers on this server.
5. When you die, a backpack container will be dropped with **all** the belongings you had on you. This includes everything in your inventory **and** on your toolbar. It does **not**, however, include your armor and boosts inserted into it. Everything else, however, is dropped.
6. See the section [Hints](hints.md) below for some more information about blueprints.
