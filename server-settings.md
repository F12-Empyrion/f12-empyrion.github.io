# Server Settings

These settings are subject to be changed. Server is currently undergoing configuration and testing, and adjustments to server settings, difficulty, can and will be made.

The [Empyrion][egs] game has plenty of settings, so here is a list of the settings that have been specifically set for this server.

| Setting                 | Value           |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Difficulty              | Hard (1)        |
| CPU Points              | Enabled (2)     |
| Check Mass / Volume     | Enabled (3)     |
| Auto Miner Depletion    | Disabled (4)    |
| Keep inventory on death | Toolbar (5)     |
| Blueprints (6)          | Not allowed (6) |

1. Enemies are tougher to kill and hit harder. Expect more drones in sectors. POIs can be deadly *(but they are still possible*).
2. CPU Points are enabled on the server. This means you must build your ship within the CPU budget available to you, which means your ships will be compromises. You cannot build one ship that is a good cargo ship, good POI buster, good against enemy ships, etc. You simply won't be able to build just one ship that can do everything. Please plan accordingly.
3. Volume and weight has been enabled. This means you have a limit to how much you can carry and you must use the Connected Toolbar to access nearby storage containers when building bases and capital vessels, otherwise you won't have room in your inventory for the big blocks. Your ships will also feel the effect of the weight. You must use container extenders to make the big containers, and your ship will get more heavy and thus more sluggish, the more cargo you stuff into it. Filling a ship to the brim could mean the difference between being groundlogged or being able to take off.
4. Autominers does not deplete deposits. However, see [Known Issues](known-issues.md) below for some *important* information about autominers on this server.
5. When you die, a backpack container will be dropped with **all** the belongings you had on you. This includes everything in your inventory **and** on your toolbar. It does **not**, however, include your armor and boosts inserted into it. Everything else, however, is dropped.
6. Blueprints will be disabled for now. We will revisit the ability to spawn things from blueprints and the workshop later, but as of now, all blueprints are disabled, everywhere. This means your only option to get a big CV is to actually build it, on the server, in survival.
