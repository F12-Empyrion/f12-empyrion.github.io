# The Great Wipe Has Completed

Long story short; the new F12 Project Eden server is now up and running.

It is a completely new server, installed from scratch, nothing brought over from the old other than looking at which configuration changes we did.

The server starts out on Project Eden 1.4.1, released on the 14th of February.

This means that:

* Nothing you built on the old server has been brought over
* You start from scratch, level 1, in an escape pod

If you prepared a CV with resources on the old server before the wipe, talk to an admin to get your stuff restored into the new server so that you can continue playing.
