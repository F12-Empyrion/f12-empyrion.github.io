# The Great Wipe

The time has come.

There are numerous problems with the server now due to its age and the incompatibility between the Project Eden scenario and the server software. We, the players,
have mostly only noticed smaller stuff, such as traders not working, but Baalij who manages the server says it is screaming for help on every restart, including
sometimes deleting shortcuts and whatnot.

It will not be possible to fix the current savegame, so unfortunately it will have to go.

However! Don't get your panties in a bunch just yet, read the rest of the page first.

## The Plan

These are the steps we will take:

1. Rename the current server to "... (Pre-wipe)"
2. Create a brand new server, with a brand new version of Project Eden
3. Configure the new server with the same settings as the old. This will be done in a hands-on manner, not copying of configuration files, to make sure we do not inherit any of the problems from the old.
4. Once the new server is ready, players can join
5. Since every player effectively starts fresh we will restore some ships and stuff, read the plan for restoring below

## When will this happen?

We will hold on to our panties and stuff until Empyrion 1.4 is out. 1.3.4 was just released. We do not know when 1.4 comes out.

However, once 1.4 is out, we can't simply do the wipe there and then. We also need to wait until Project Eden 1.4 has been updated.

## How you can prepare

**You should prepare right now! DO NOT wait until 1.4 is out. For all we know, 1.4 will be unplayable.**

To prepare for the wipe, you should do the following:

1. Create a new CV, either on Haven, or somewhere in space where it won't get attacked. Haven is bugged so no attacks take place. IT DOES NOT HAVE TO FUNCTION AS A SHIP. It needs to be the CV starter + cargo containers. THAT'S IT. If you can't build a CV, either ask for help from the admins, or build a SV. SV is fine as well.
2. Place cargo containers on the CV, that's it.
3. Transfer ALL the materials, components, ore, weapons, ammo, WHATEVER you want to bring you to the new server to cargo containers on this CV.
4. Name it something easy to recognize, a suggestion is "YourPlayerName ARK". Whatever you name it, **make a note of the name**
5. Make blueprints of ALL the bases, small ships, capital vessels, hover vessels that you either want us to spawn on the new server for you, or that you plan on rebuilding yourself.

**To make a blueprint of something, point your cursor on it and hit *Alt-O*, the blueprint screen should come up and then you click the *Save as...* button and give it a name. Do this for all your stuff, and give them recognizable names (for you).**

**Go into [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VFUpc_FkLSodBAiMUJX3TtFwt1h7hmv_DuT6qgfisLE/edit?usp=sharing) and enter information about the ships and structures you want help spawned on the new server**

## How we will restore your stuff

The restore will be done as follows:

1. The CV you built will be restored from backup wholesale. It will contain all the stuff you put into it, no changes. This should give you a good start on the new server.
2. You will then queue up a blueprint for a capital vessel, or a small vessel, or whatnot, in YOUR OWN factory, and the admin will complete it for you instantly, without requiring resources. **This is why it is important that you make blueprints of your ships**.
3. XP and some credits will be fixed.
4. Reputation can be discussed.

While we want to ensure people don't feel cheated, we do not plan on restoring ALL your ships and structures.

## Anticipated Questions

**Q:** What if I haven't played for a while, and only come back *after* you have done the wipe?  
**A:** The old server will be kept, so in this case we will figure it out.

**Q:** Will traders work after the wipe?  
**A:** Yes, that's part of why we will do the wipe

**Q:** Will I start at level 1 again?  
**A:** Yes, but we can fix that.

**Q:** Will I start without credits?  
**A:** Initially, yes, but we will give everyone some credits. Note that everyone will be given the same amount, and it will be something like 100.000 credits. Instead you might want to stock up on weapons or whatnot you can sell to the traders on the new server.

**Q:** What if ...?  
**A:** We will figure it out. The wipe is not done to reset everyone back to the stoneage, the wipe is necessary because the server will soon be unplayable. As such we will figure out how to deal with whatever that comes up of requests and wishes.
