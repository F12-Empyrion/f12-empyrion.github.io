# Code of Conduct

There is just one rule on this server: **Everybody gets to have fun!**.

With that in mind, here's a more detailed breakdown about the code of conduct we expect everyone to follow.

This is a **PvE** server. There is some information that might indicate that some areas, playfields, in the game are flagged as **PvP**. This is unsupported and unwelcome. This is **not** a **PvP** server, purely **PvE**. Should there be incidents where players outright grief or kill other players with intent, the admins will almost certainly have a word with you.

If anyone finds a playfield marked as PvP, please let an admin know. We don't know if we can change it safely but at least being aware of which playfields are marked as such would be useful.

Also note that surface area around bases might be deformable by anyone, in any faction. This is also considered griefing if it is not done with the approval of the owner(s) of the base, so please don't do that. Again, overly aggressive griefing will be dealt with.

Other than that, **be nice**, **respect others** and above all else, **have fun**. Hit the full stop, or *dot*, to open the textchat in game and chat us up, or preferrably join the discord channel (see [Discord](discord.md)). If you don't want to talk to anyone but your friends that you joined with, that's cool too.
