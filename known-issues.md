# Known Issues

* Sometimes you can get stuck in an endless loading screen while loading structures. It happens rarely, but it does happen. This is most likely a bug in the game and nothing with the server, as most players can resolve this by forcibly quitting the game (Alt+F4) and retrying. Sometimes it takes several attempts. A theory is that the bug is related to loading of complex structures and playfields, so depending on where you are in the game it may occur more or less often.
* Sometimes after having loaded in you notice that your base or your ships seems to be cut in half, turned off, and you might be standing on rock below where the missing portions of your ship or base is located. If this happens, try to move to a spot where you *know* that you are inside your base, or on safe ground, and then relog. This is a loading bug in 99.99% cases and a relog usually fixes this straight away. If something is still missing after one or two such relogs, please seek help from an admin.

    **It is *HIGHLY* important** that you do not try to use your ships or your structures if you load into such a cut-off state, or you risk the missing pieces becoming permanently missing. In this case you can request [help from an admin](admin-services.md) to restore your structures from backup.
* Autominers placed on deposits will be **wiped** during [server restart](server-restarts.md) every morning at 03:00. You can use Autominers on this server, but you **must** retrieve them **and** their content before server reset or you *will lose them*. If this has already happened to you because you did not know about this problem, please seek admin help. This is an issue with the way the deposits are reset and not by choice. As such there is nothing we can do about this problem right now other than to be aware of it.
