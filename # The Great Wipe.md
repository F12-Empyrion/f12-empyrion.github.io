# The Great Wipe

We're currently running version 1.2 of the Project Eden scenario, which makes heavy customization to the game configuration files.
The game client, however, is at 1.3 as of writing this.

These two are unfortunately not 100% compatible, and there are some [known issues](known-issues.md), such as traders not working.

Because of this, we assume there will be a point in the future when the version differences will be large enough that our savegame no longer properly works.
There could be problems ranging everywhere from being able to do basic gameplay loops, to control panels not working, POIs glitching out, etc. etc.

Basically, we don't know what might happen, but be assume something will, at some point in the future.

So, the basic question then is: What about now? Is it pointless to build stuff? Mine stuff? Gather stuff?

No, far from it. While we acknowledge that the savegame itself might become borked at some point, all the things we own will still be compatible, so here is the current plan:

1. We'll wait until we're *forced* to do a wipe, in the sense that our current savegame no longer works (according to some definition, but it will have to be pretty severe)
2. We'll do a wipe, which means essentially all planets, bases, ships, everything, for everyone, is deleted.
3. We will then restore, from backup of *the previous server*, some ships and/or bases and/or whatever, for everyone that is currently playing. If this includes resources in the cargo containers, then good, otherwise a sensible portion of such resources will be awarded each player. "Sensible" as in "We will make every effort to make sure you're OK with the situation".

This will, unfortunately, mean that we all lose something, but it doesn't mean we will start from scratch. If the game is still allowing us to log in and do stuff, without everything working, at some point the message would be to prepare for the wipe by stuffing your CV or base full of resources and whatnot, so that when it is restored from backup it allows you to get a good start.
