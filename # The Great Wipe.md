# The Great Wipe

Here's some updated information.

Version 1.4 of Empyrion dropped today, 4th of February 2021.  
Project Eden 1.4 dropped in an initial version on 4th of February 2021.

However, the author of Project Eden has said that he will release an updated version around the 12th, and that if anyone wants to start a new Project Eden game in 1.4, they should wait for this updated version.

**So that's what we're going to do.**

Our server owner will need to plan the update, it will likely require the cooperation of several of the admins and helpers to test, but at least now we can say that unless the server breaks down completely before the 12th, we will hold off until the updated Project Eden 1.4 scenario is released on the 12th.

So you now have extra time to prepare for the Big Wipe.

Also, know that traders have started working again. Haven't tested them all but it seems Polaris Orbital Trading Station and planetary Trading Stations have functioning traders again. Now might be a good time to spend your credits if you have some, to buy supplies for the new server.

This page will be updated with more of an exact date and plans once the server owner has looked into when he has time to do the update.

We're currently running version 1.2 of the Project Eden scenario, which makes heavy customization to the game configuration files.
The game client, however, is at 1.3 as of writing this.

These two are unfortunately not 100% compatible, and there are some [known issues](known-issues.md), such as traders not working.

Because of this, we assume there will be a point in the future when the version differences will be large enough that our savegame no longer properly works.
There could be problems ranging everywhere from being able to do basic gameplay loops, to control panels not working, POIs glitching out, etc. etc.

Basically, we don't know what might happen, but be assume something will, at some point in the future.

So, the basic question then is: What about now? Is it pointless to build stuff? Mine stuff? Gather stuff?

No, far from it. While we acknowledge that the savegame itself might become borked at some point, all the things we own will still be compatible, so here is the current plan:

1. We'll wait until we're *forced* to do a wipe, in the sense that our current savegame no longer works (according to some definition, but it will have to be pretty severe)
2. We'll do a wipe, which means essentially all planets, bases, ships, everything, for everyone, is deleted.
3. We will then restore, from backup of *the previous server*, some ships and/or bases and/or whatever, for everyone that is currently playing. If this includes resources in the cargo containers, then good, otherwise a sensible portion of such resources will be awarded each player. "Sensible" as in "We will make every effort to make sure you're OK with the situation".

This will, unfortunately, mean that we all lose something, but it doesn't mean we will start from scratch. If the game is still allowing us to log in and do stuff, without everything working, at some point the message would be to prepare for the wipe by stuffing your CV or base full of resources and whatnot, so that when it is restored from backup it allows you to get a good start.
