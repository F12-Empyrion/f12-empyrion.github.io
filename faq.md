# Frequently Asked Questions

## When does planetary deposits, asteroids, POIs reset?

See [server restarts](server-restarts.md).

## Does Autominers work here? I've heard there are some issues

See the page on [known issues](known-issues.md) for more information.

## The server is not listed in the server list, what happened to it?

Hopefully there is an ongoing [maintenance](maintenance.md). On occasion there has also been other reasons for the server going down, such as a sudden Windows Update performing a reset and needing some
input. If you can't find the server in the list, and no current or scheduled maintenance is listed either, please contact us on [discord](discord.md) or [by email](mailto:lasse@vkarlsen.no?subject?F12+Server+down?).
