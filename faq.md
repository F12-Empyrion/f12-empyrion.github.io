# Frequently Asked Questions

## I keep hearing people talking about a possible wipe, what's up?

Read more about the [great wipe here](the-great-wipe.md).

## When does planetary deposits, asteroids, POIs reset?

See [server restarts](server-restarts.md).

## Does Autominers work here? I've heard there are some issues

See the page on [known issues](known-issues.md) for more information.

## The server is not listed in the server list, what happened to it?

Hopefully there is an ongoing [maintenance](maintenance.md). On occasion there has also been other reasons for the server going down, such as a sudden Windows Update performing a reset and needing some
input. If you can't find the server in the list, and no current or scheduled maintenance is listed either, please contact us on [discord](discord.md) or [by email](mailto:lasse@vkarlsen.no?subject?F12+Server+down?).

## HALP! Half my base or ship is missing after login, what do I do?

First of all, don't panic. Second of all, visit the [known issues](known-issues.md) page for more information. Thirdly, don't panic! :)

## Do I need to have both T2, T3, *and* T4 CPU extenders on my ship for it to be CPU T4 compliant?

First of all, know that our [server settings](server-settings.md) have disabled CPU points. As such, on the F12 server **it is not necessary** to use CPU extenders at all. However, if you want to
build something you can publish on the workshop that you want to be CPU compliant, then you would need them.

The answer to the question is that no, you do *not* need all the tiers of CPU extenders for it to be the highest CPU tier. Let me rephrase that, if you want your ship to be T4 cpu compliant, all you need
is the 4 T4 CPU extenders. You do not need the T2 CPU extender nor the two T3 extenders.

*However*, if one or more of the T4 CPU extenders gets destroyed, your ship will drop down to the previous tier *available*. This means that if you *only* have the 4 T4 CPU extenders and one of them gets destroyed, your ship drops to T1, which is just the core, and might operate very poorly, if at all. If you also had the T3 CPU extenders, your ship would drop to T3 instead and might operate better in an emergency situation.

So whether you need/want the T2 and T3 CPU extenders in your ship or not is up to you to decide.

## I want to build a workshop blueprint, but it requires CPU extenders which are costly, can I avoid this?

Since CPU points are disabled [on our server](server-settings.md), you don't need those CPU extenders if you only want to have the ship on this server.

In order to avoid having to appropriate or build the CPU extenders required for the blueprint, there is a very simple procedure.

1. Subscribe to the blueprint, which you have probably already done
2. Restart the game but don't rejoin the F12 server. Remember that you need to exit the game client completely to get newly subscribed blueprints to appear.
3. Create a new creative game, or resume an existing one if you already have one.
4. Use the F2 blueprint factory menu to spawn a copy of the blueprint for free in creative mode
5. Hit P when aiming at the structure and go to the Devices tab, then locate the CPU extenders you want to get rid of
6. Enable "Show in HUD" for each of them, to get a nice white indicator on your structure exactly where they are
7. Use a Multi Tool or just shift-right-click on the extenders with a normal block to delete them
8. When you're satisfied, aim at the structure and hit Alt+O, then save your new structure under a name of your choosing
9. Log into the F12 server and build your new blueprint instead of the one from the workshop

Note that you can use the above procedure to simplify any blueprint by removing blocks and devices you don't want or need, or don't have the resources for. This is a good way to get the cost down and leave space for upgrades later.
