# Discord

The server has an accompanying [Discord](https://discord.com/) server, open to anyone playing on the **F12** server.

You can join it by clicking [here][joindiscord], or by clicking on the + inside Discord and entering the code **`ataYfPV`**.

If you have questions about the game, about the server, or preferrably just want to hang out, feel free to join. You will most likely find us in the `#Empyrion` voice channel.

The official language on the Discord server in the Empyrion game channels is English, though you will most likely hear a smattering of Norwegian from time to time. Pester us about it and we'll improve :)

There is a linked text chat on Discord named `#empyrion`, found under the `CHATS` general heading. This one is linked to global chat in game on the server. This means you can talk to people that are playing even if you are only online through Discord, or vice versa. Keep up with your friends and what is happening on the server, even while you are not actually playing.
