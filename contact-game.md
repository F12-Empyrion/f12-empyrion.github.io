# Contact Us

There are various ways to talk to either the owners or admins of the server, or to the other players.

Here are all the ways.

1. Use text-chat in the game. You can hit `.`, the full stop, or dot, to enter text-chat, and just type your questions or messages in there. Use the Global channel (tabs at the top of the window) to reach out to admins and other players alike.
2. Join our [discord server](discord.md) and see if there is anyone online in one of the Empyrion-related text- or voice-channels.
3. Send an email to [lasse@vkarlsen.no](mailto:lasse@vkarlsen.no?subject=F12+Empyrion+Server) and I'll make sure the right person gets it.
