# Wipe Empty Playfields

After some discussions and having some experience with this configuration we're turning this back off.

The short story of what it was supposed to do was that it was supposed to wipe empty playfields. "Empty" here means that no player structures exists on the playfield, and no player has logged out there. This only takes effect when no player is in the playfield so "no player online" is not a factor.

However, it turns out it is wiping more than it's supposed to. Additionally, people are having accidents with the teleporter in that they're ported to a location far away from where they intended. We believe this is linked to this playfield wipe.

Hence, we're turning it off.

This means that once again, **killing ships in sectors is permanent!**

We're making a second configuration change at the same time to compensate somewhat for this. We know the situation is not ideal but it looks like the fix was worse than the problems.

You can turn in "Navigational Data", a data pad item you can find in Ultra Rare loot containers (perhaps in Very rare as well?). This allows you to increase your maximum warp range beyond the 50 that the warp drives allow. The previous maximum upgrade was +50, so that you could warp a total of 100 LY in one jump.

We're increasing this max upgrade to +125 LY. If you gather enough navigational data and turn them in you can increase your warp range from 50 all the way up to 175 (50 + 125) LY.

These jumps comes with a cost, you will have to pay the pentaxid for them, but it should allow you to more quickly get out and about in the vast galaxy and thus increase your chance of finding ships.

**This update will happen later tonight, Friday 12th of March, when there are fewer players online.**
