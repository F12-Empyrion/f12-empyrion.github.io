# Chatbot

A chatbot has been activated on the server. You can access it by typing in `cb:?` in any of the textchat tabs. Try using the faction tab to minimze the spam for others. Make sure to spell it correct, you need both the colon and the question mark for it to be valid.

The chatbot can help with some common issues, such as moving you to a nearby ship, or getting information about when things happen on the server. The `cb:?` command will give you a list of all supported commands. Note that some of these commands give you "cheat like" functions, such as the one which moves you to your ship. They are, however, a crutch to lean on if bugs crop up and no admin is online. Use with caution.
