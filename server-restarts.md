# Server Restarts

The server restarts periodically, both to ensure good server health but also to perform periodic maintenance and wipe mechanics.

All times shown here are GMT+2, more information [here](timezone.md).

| What                             | Time  | Days            |
| -------------------------------- | ----- | --------------- |
| Restart                          | 03:00 | Every day       |
| Deposits reset                   | 03:00 | Every day       |
| Points of Interests (POIs) reset | 03:00 | Tuesday, Friday |
| Asteroids reset                  | 03:00 | Tuesday, Friday |

Every morning at 03:00 the server performs a restart. Players will be warned several times during the 15 minutes in advance of the restart. Players should
log out to avoid anomalies. The restart takes about 20-30 minutes so if you want to keep playing, wait for it to reappear in your server list to rejoin. With the linked Discord chat you can monitor Discord for the "Server started!" message to know when it is back up.

Planetary deposits resets during this server restart. This will in most cases reset the terrain above the deposits, but depending on how big of an area of the surrounding terrain has been mined there may still be artefacts of mining present. The ores should be back, however.

POIs are reset twice a week, every Tuesday and Friday during server restart. Structures will then respawn, surrounding terrain should be reset, and loot inside will be randomized.
