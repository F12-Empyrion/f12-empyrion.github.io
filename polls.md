# Polls

From time to time we might conduct polls that tells us what the player community on the server thinks about various topics. This can include both topics suggested by the server owners/admins or any of the players.

## Ongoing polls

At this time we have no polls going.

## Information about Google sign-in

Note that in order to prevent people from voting multiple times on a single poll, and thus "game the system", we turn on the setting that you have to sign in with Google before you can respond.

However, Google does not tell us any information about who has responded, so even if it is a controversial topic for the server, nobody will be able to tell who responded what, and so everyone should be completely free to voice their opinion, whatever it might be. Please refrain from writing any personally identifying information in any open text fields in polls, as these will be sent to us as they are written.

## Previous polls

Previous polls and their results will be posted here. If any decisions were made, the decision will also be posted here.
