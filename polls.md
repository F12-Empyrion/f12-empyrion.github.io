# Polls

From time to time we might conduct polls that tells us what the player community on the server thinks about various topics. This can include both topics suggested by the server owners/admins or any of the players.

## Ongoing polls

At this time we have one poll going:

* [F12 Empyrion Server Poll - Teleporter Range](https://forms.gle/iyNCLVfdkrtPPSy27)

## Information about Google sign-in

Note that in order to prevent people from voting multiple times on a single poll, and thus "game the system", we turn on the setting that you have to sign in with Google before you can respond.

However, Google does not tell us any information about who has responded, so even if it is a controversial topic for the server, nobody will be able to tell who responded what, and so everyone should be completely free to voice their opinion, whatever it might be. Please refrain from writing any personally identifying information in any open text fields in polls, as these will be sent to us as they are written.

## Previous polls

Each poll will tell you a little bit about what it asks of you, and also tell you approximately when the poll will be closed and what happens next. If a poll ends up with a decision (including a decision not to change anything), previous polls and their results will be posted here.

There has not yet been any polls conducted. This will be updated when polls close and decisions are made.
