# 10 most important facts if you're a new player on the server

If you're a new player on the server, Welcome!

Here are the 10 most important facts you probably want to know right away.

1. The server is PvE through and through. If you find a sector that allows PvP, that's a kind of bug, and is not to be exploited by anyone. We play together, not against each other.
2. Volume and weight, and CPU points, are all disabled. You do not need CPU Extenders for your bases or ships on this server, however if you make workshop blueprints for others then you might want to "vanilla-proof" your creations by adding them in there.
3. Sector ships, asteroids and POIs are reset every Tuesday and Friday at 03:00 CET, deposits reset every day at 03:00 CET.
4. No starter planets or playfields are wiped, unless they're empty. You're free to build and stay and live on any of the starter planets as long as you wish.
5. The server is running on Hard difficulty. Be prepared when attacking stuff. Also, it's recommended to make some friends and go at stuff together.
6. Minor adjustments to some settings. Most notably, T2 CV shields are worth 100.000 hitpoints, SV and HV shields are doubled (from vanilla). Heavy armor has 500 hitpoints, and epic heavy has 700.
7. Yes, there are glitches with the Project Eden scenario. If you find a system you can't warp to (you're left where you tried to warp from), please try to warp a few more times. Most often it works on the 3rd attempt. This is a problem with complex system generation that takes a bit of time to complete.
8. We're a easy going bunch. We have lots of players playing by themselves or with their faction, and we have players that want company and play with others. Either way you want to play is fine by us. We're here if you want help, company, a scapegoat for your failed POI attempt, or whatever.
9. We have a discord server, [here](discord.md), which you are in no way required to join, but feel free to do so if you want. In particular we have linked the "public-chat" under Empyrion with the in-game chat so you can stay in touch with everyone else even if you're not currently playing.
10. We aim to please. If you have questions or requests, don't hesitate to speak up. We have the keywords "admin" and "server" on notification list in Discord so if you require help, just include those words in your message and hopefully an admin will be able to help you out. Note that we do not have 24/7 admins, but some of us can join from time to time to help.

If none of your questions was answered by the above list, please check the [main page](index.md), or ask in-game, or [send me an email](mailto:lasse@vkarlsen.no) and we'll figure it out together.

Most important, point 11: **Have fun and enjoy yourself!**

And again, welcome!
