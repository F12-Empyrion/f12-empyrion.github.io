# Factions

Every new player joins the **Human** faction. It is recommended that you leave this faction and create your own for you and your friends, instead of staying in the common Human faction.

**Warning:** If you have already built bases or vessels in the game before you opt to move to your own faction, *remember* to set everything as **Private** in the control panel of each construct before leaving the Human faction. If you forget, you lose access to your creation. If this happens to you, please ask for admin help to fix this.

The reason behind this recommendation is that if you're in a faction with many other players, you lose the ability to share your bases and vessels with only a select group of people, as the only choices you have are private (aka only you), or everybody in the faction. You *can* set codes on many blocks to allow only people who know the code to use them, but this gets very cumbersome fast.

Additionally, if someone goes to war against Polaris, and the Human faction ends up with Hostile faction relationship with them, your bases will be attacked by Polaris, and more importantly, *you will lose access to their trading stations*. As such, you want to be in control of your own fate.

If, as a new player, you end up inheriting hostile relationship with Talon or Polaris, and this is brought over to your new faction, please ask for admin help to rectify this.
