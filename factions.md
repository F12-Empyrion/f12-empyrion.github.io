# Factions

Every new player joins without a faction. It is recommended that you create your own for you and your friends, instead of joining the common Human faction.

**Warning:** If you have already joined a faction and built bases or vessels in the game before you opt to switch to a different faction, *remember* to set everything that is *yours* as **Private** in the control panel of each construct before leaving your current faction. If you forget, you lose access to your creation. If this happens to you, please ask for admin help to fix this.

The reason behind this recommendation is that if you're in a faction with many other players, you lose the ability to share your bases and vessels with only a select group of people, as the only choices you have are private (aka only you), or everybody in the faction. You *can* set codes on many blocks to allow only people who know the code to use them, but this gets very cumbersome fast.

Additionally, if someone in your faction goes to war against Polaris, and your faction ends up with Hostile faction relationship with them, your bases will be attacked by Polaris, and more importantly, *you will lose access to their trading stations*. As such, you want to be in control of your own fate.

If, as a new player, you end up inheriting hostile relationship with Talon or Polaris, and this is brought over to your new faction, please ask for [admin help](admin-services.md) help to rectify this.
