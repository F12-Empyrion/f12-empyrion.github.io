# Project Eden

This server is running the [Project Eden][pe] custom scenario.

This scenario adjusts balance in multiple ways, and if you're interested in a full rundown of all its facets, please follow the above link to the Steam Workshop page for all the information you want.

Here, however, are some of the most important changes this scenario brings, compared to the standard game.

* Ore distribution has changed

    Starter planets does not have Cobalt. Zascosium and Erestrum is not found in the starting system, so in order to find some you either have to raid POIs and hope to get some, or create a minimal CV with warp capabilities in order to find nearby systems which has these resources. This change was done to slow down the progress towards end game.
* Many many many more POI types

    Expect many more diverse wreckages and ruins scattered across the universe. The Project Eden scenario contains over 1000 custom POI structures, in addition to all the ones found in the standard game. This makes the game more enjoyable as there is much more variety to the places you visit.
* Almost all deposits on planets use the "nugget style" instead of the "different texture" style. Having an Ore Detector in your inventory is a good idea.
* More diverse starting planets, and more starting planets in general
* Custom created planets and moons, in rare cases to have an extreme amount of a certain type of resource
